	<h2>Technology Stack</h2>
	<p>
    Grommet is based on <a href="http://reactjs.com" target="_blank">ReactJS</a> which provides great features in JavaScript for building user interfaces.
    You'll also use a JavaScript syntax extension called <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/jsx-in-depth.html" target="_blank">JSX</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    We expect that you have at least a basic understanding on these technologies to be able to master Grommet, in addition to JavaScript of course. In terms of cascading style sheets (css), Grommet provides everything you need to quickly create applications based on the application <a data-to="design">Style Guide</a>. Under the hood, you'll find <a href="http://inuitcss.com/" target="_blank">InuitCSS</a> and <a href="http://sass-lang.com/" target="_blank">Sass</a> to compile the style sheets. But, don&#39;t worry, you are not expected to write a lot of CSS when using Grommet.  We've done that for you.  But if you would like to contribute, please do so!
